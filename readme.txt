During this assignment, I saw how to consolidate CSS styles so that you can group multiple headers and texts together. 
I also learned how to hpyerlink within the same page.
Learning Github was something I was already somewhat familiar with.
However this really helped me clean some of the rust off and feel more comfortable with it.
